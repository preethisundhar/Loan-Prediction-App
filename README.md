# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction System (Machine Learning + Streamlit)

An end-to-end **Machine Learning–based financial application** that predicts whether a loan will be **Approved or Rejected** based on applicant financial, credit, and asset details.

The system is designed to assist banks and financial institutions in **automating loan decision-making** with speed, consistency, and data-driven insights.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Loan approval is a critical process that depends on multiple factors such as income, credit score, employment status, and asset ownership. Manual evaluation is time-consuming and prone to bias.

This project builds, evaluates, and deploys a **Machine Learning classification model** that predicts loan approval outcomes and exposes the model through a **professional Streamlit web application**.

The trained model is **serialized using Joblib** and used for real-time predictions via the web interface.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Perform data preprocessing and feature handling
- Train multiple Machine Learning classification models
- Evaluate models using appropriate performance metrics
- Select the best-performing model
- Save the trained ML model using **Joblib**
- Deploy the model using **Streamlit** for real-time loan prediction

---

## 🧪 Models Trained

The following Machine Learning models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- KNeighbors Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier   
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Gradient Boosting
- xgBoost Classifier
- **RandomForest Classifier (Selected Model)**

### 🔍 Model Selection Criteria

| Model          | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|---------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Random Forest | 0.9824   | 0.9850    | 0.9868 | 0.9859   | **0.9987** |


📌 Random Forest was selected as the final model due to its excellent performance across all metrics, particularly the highest ROC-AUC score.

---

## 🧠 Model Evaluation Strategy

The model evaluates loan approval likelihood based on applicant risk profile:

- Higher income and asset value increase approval probability
- Strong credit (CIBIL) score improves approval chances
- Loan amount and loan term are balanced against financial strength

The trained model generalizes well to unseen data and is suitable for deployment in a decision-support system.
